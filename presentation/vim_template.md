# Vim
## Text File Editor
### Presentations

# Introduction: Me

* I
    * am a
        * software developer
        * vim lover
    * am from Commit Khong


# Introduction: Topic

# Vim: A Text File Editor

## Installation

It's likely that vim already pre-install in your os, or if it's not:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim/src
    make
```

# Why?

* Development workflow
* Mouse is redundent
* Fun way to type syntax
* It speaks the hunan-language when typing
    * More intuitive than Nano :))

# Why: Part 2 - Examples

For example, suppose I was doing some refactoring like remove some paramamters
in a method

In normal, we have to use mouse to highlight the text we want to remove or
set the cursor at the very end of string and keep hitting `delete` button.
-> every action need us to corectly place the cursor a some position, which
sometime it's not.

With Vim, we have the ability to make everything just in place and efficiently
in term of number of button we hit

-> Basically:

* move the cursor into method parentheses.
* hit `d` `i` `)` (or `(`)
    * `d` means delete
    * `i` means inside
    * `)` means, yes `parentheses`

* context switching between
    * running the program in a separate terminal
    * creating yet another terminal (or browser) to interact with the running program
    * possibly pulling up an IDE to show/modify the actual source being run

It gets complicated. I don't like complicated

# Why: Part 4.1

I also wanted to make it easy to create extensions that can have a first-chance
opportunity to handle specific markdown rendering events.

E.g. below is the code to render code blocks:

```python
@contrib_first
def render_code(token, body, stack, loop):
    """Renders a code block using the Pygments library.

    See :any:`lookatme.tui.SlideRenderer.do_render` for additional argument and
    return value descriptions.
    """
    lang = token.get("lang", "text") or "text"
    res = pygments_render.render_text(token["text"], lang=lang)

    return [
        urwid.Divider(),
        res,
        urwid.Divider(),
    ]
```

# Why: Part 4.2

Below is the code used by file loader to provide an alternative rendering of
the code blocks:

```python
def render_code(token, body, stack, loop):
    """Render the code, ignoring all code blocks except ones with the language
    set to ``file``.
    """
    lang = token["lang"] or ""
    if lang != "file":
        raise IgnoredByContrib

    file_info_data = token["text"]
    file_info = FileSchema().loads(file_info_data)

    # ...

    token["text"] = file_data
    token["lang"] = file_info["lang"]
    raise IgnoredByContrib
```

# Summary

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
> document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like
> itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

[Mark Gruber, Markdown Co-Creator](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

In keeping with the original Markdown philosophy, here are these slides
rendered in Github: [slides](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/tree/master/presentations/san_diego_python_meetup/2019-12-20.md)

Not everything carries over, but it's still pretty readable.
