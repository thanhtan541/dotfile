Effort -> high (learning curve is extremely steep)
Useful -> high (programmer)
Ubitquious -> high (broadly used accross platform, vi-ish in many tools and platform)
Productive -> hardly no -> we think more than we type

So why?

Fun thing can do with Vim:

1 - Programming in your way of typing
2 - Macro stuff
3 - Better Navigation

Cool features that other editor/ide does not have (yet).

1 - Registers (multiple copies)
2 - Time travel (earlier/later in command mode) 
3 - Calculator builtin (Ctrl R = in insert mode)
4 - Auto increments (Crtl A / Ctrl X)
